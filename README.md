## Project Description
We will develop a budget-tracking Desktop Java GUI application. The user can enter a monthly income and make a budget for various categories such as food, entertainment, transportation, savings, etc. 
They can record purchases, and the application will notify the user if they are over budget. Features are tentative at the moment.
