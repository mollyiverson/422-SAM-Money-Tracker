## Project Description
This is a budget-tracking Desktop Java GUI application used to learn SOFTWARE TESTING. We did not spend much time creating the ideal UI and software. We created unit, integration, and system tests.<br /><br />
The user can enter a monthly income and make a budget for various categories such as food, entertainment, transportation, savings, etc. They can record purchases, and the application will notify the user if they are over budget.
